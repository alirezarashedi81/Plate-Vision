🚗 License Plate Recognition System

This project is a real-time license plate recognition system designed specifically for Indian car models. It detects, tracks, and captures license plates with high accuracy, even in crowded traffic scenes.

  ✨ Features
  
  🔍 Car Detection & Tracking – Fine-tuned YOLO model for detecting cars in Indian traffic.
  
  🏷️ License Plate Recognition – Custom-trained plate detection model captures and saves plates.
  
  💾 Auto-Save & Rename – Each plate is saved and renamed to the corresponding car ID number.
  
  ⚡ Quantized Model – Optimized for speed and efficiency on resource-limited devices.
  
  ☁️ Cloud Deployment – Deployed on Azure for scalable and real-world applications.
  
  🎯 High Reliability – Tested in crowded traffic with no ID switch issues.

📊 Tech Stack
