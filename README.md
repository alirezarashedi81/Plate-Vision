# ðŸš— License Plate Recognition & Tracking System  

This project is a real-time **car detection, tracking, and license plate recognition system**, fine-tuned specifically on **Indian car models**. The system detects vehicles, captures their license plates, and automatically saves/renames them with unique car IDs. It is **quantized for efficiency**, achieving **high accuracy** while remaining lightweight for deployment.
